# Just Draw It server app
Interactive paperboard websocket server. 

POOA group java5 : Ludovic Descateaux, Brieuc Loussouarn

This app is a drawing collaborative app. You can chat and create a design in live remotely and see what other drawers
 are doing. 

## User experience
1. Simply authenticate with your favorite pseudo
    * 2 users can't have the same pseudo : Find yours !
    * if you get disconnected the pseudo become free again
2. Create or join a board
    * 2 boards can't have the same title
    * When creating you cn choose a background image or a background color for your board
3. Choose a drawing
    * different drawings are available :
        * Hand Writing
        * Line
        * Rectangle
        * Circle
        * Import icon
4. Edit a shape
    * Select a shape by clicking on it
    * Use the right panel to choose your options
    
   // PICTURE
   
    * Click on the drawing
4. Chat and see drawers
    * See who is connected
    * Use the chat to communicate with them
5. Take a picture
6. Leave the board
7. Be the member of a new one





  


## Install and run
- clone or pull the repo
- download the maven dependencies written in the pom.xml file (mvn install)
- start the server with run
- setup your jdk to 11.0.4
- Run the app in your IDE, should listen socket request on localhost:8025
- WARNING : if your frontend is not listening on port between 3000 and 3010 you need to add the port to the CORS list
 in WebSocketServerConfigurator.java

## Run the tests
Use your IDE to run the different junit test and understand what they are doing.

### Architecture and Design

// TODO Petit LaÃ¯us sur l'architecture globale.
#### Class Diagram

*drawings* package :

![Drawing package](./readme_assets/drawings_package.png)

For this we have chose to have two heritage with two abstract class Shape and Drawing. Drawing describe all the
 elements of the paperboard with a unique id.
 
Shape Class define all paperboard objects containing lines we can edit.

You should have a look to the override methods `editDrawing` and `encodeToJsonObject`.

*server* package :

![Drawing package](./readme_assets/server_package.png)

*server* package with *socket* and *events* package :

![Drawing package](./readme_assets/package_server_splitted.png)

In this diagram you can see the observer pattern detailed bellow.

#### Observer Pattern
// LUDO

#### Socket message logic

As you can see in the enum MessageType, we have design a set of message to be sure to always use the same string.

Event send from the frontend are handled in WebSocketServerEndPoint, see the onMessage method. I most of the case
internal event are fired (see EventType enum) and handled in WebsocketServer because it's a singleton pattern to
 reduce the number of message sent.
 

Flow description : 

// TODO DIAG DE SEQUENCE SUR LES MESSAGES

- WebSocketServerEndPoint.open -> fire : EventType.DRAWER_CONNECTED -> listen by nobody
- WebSocketServerEndPoint.onMessage :
    * MessageType.MSG_IDENTIFY -> fire : EventType.ASK_IDENTITY -> call PaperboardApplication.addUser -> fire EventType
    .DRAWER_IDENTIFICATION -> call WebSocketServerEndPoint.handleEventDrawerIdentification() in WebsocketServer -> send MessageType.MSG_IDENTITY_ANSWER
    * MessageType.MSG_GET_BOARD
    * MessageType.MSG_GET_ALL_BOARDS

### Technical choices


#### Socket with strings 

#### Dependencies
See ./pom.xml
- java 11
- io.projectreactor : have @Nullable
- junit : for the tests
- javax.websocket : websocket serverdepandencies
- org.glassfish.tyrus : websocket server
- javax.json : dependencies to deal with json
